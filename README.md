# CWA-Model
The CWA model was employed to analyse key risk influential factors (RIFs) for marine accidents across different vessel types. This research advances multidimensional factor analysis from static to dynamic, enabling the development of more tailored preventive measures. The code repository for our publication, " A novel integrated method for heterogeneity analysis of marine accidents involving different ship types," is available in Ocean Engineering.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this paper is to address the limitations in existing marine accident studies, particularly in analysing accident heterogeneity across different ship types. While previous research has identified differences in RIFs across ship types, most studies lack in-depth quantitative analysis and fail to propose targeted preventive measures. To address this gap, this study presents a comprehensive approach that integrates Complex Networks (CN), the Weighted Influence Nonlinear Gauge System (WINGS), and Adversarial Interpretive Structural Modeling (AISM). The aim is to thoroughly examine the heterogeneous risks of accidents among different ship types and explore the dynamic causal relationships among RIFs. This research not only advances theoretical development in maritime safety but also provides an empirical foundation for authorities to develop diversified safety management strategies.

Figure 3 illustrates the framework of the CWA model. First, based on CN theory, RINs of RIFs for marine accidents involving different ship types are constructed, and topological analyses of these RINs are performed. Second, the centrality, causality, and weight of the RIFs are calculated and analysed using WINGS. Finally, AISM is applied to identify the internal connections of the RIFs and establish the logical hierarchical relationships between RIFs.
